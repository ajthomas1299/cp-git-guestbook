            <h4>Hello Everyone!</h4>
            <p>This week I learned the value of a testimonial!</p>

            <p>Qazi, one of my mentor's at Clever Programmer, told me to think of
                a testimonial as $3,000 in your hand.
            </p>

            <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for them!</h4>
            <p>If you have taught someone one thing, whether it be family or friends or an aquaintance, they can give
                you a testimonial. </p>

            <h4>Help them write one!</h4>
            <p>Give them this general testimonial outline to help them write one.
                It doesn't have to be long or flashy, ask them: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Where were you before working with me?</li>
                <li> Where were you after working with me?</li>
                <li> What was working with me like?</li>
                <li> What would you say to someone who is on the fence
                    about working with me?
                </li>
            </ol>
